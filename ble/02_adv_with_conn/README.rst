BLE Connectable Advertising Demo using Zephyr
======================================================

Overview
--------
This application demonstrates how to configure a BLE peripheral in Zephyr
to perform **connectable advertising** with manufacturer-specific data
and a URI in the scan response.  

The program is based on concepts from the Nordic Developer Academy BLE
course but adapted for **ESP32-S3 DevKitC**. 

Board: **ESP32S3_DevKitC**

Zephyr Version: **v4.2.0-2290-g617b71bc174b** 

Key features:
 - Uses a fixed random static Bluetooth address
 - Configures connectable advertising with ~500 ms interval
 - Advertises:
    * Complete device name
    * Manufacturer-specific company ID
 - Scan Response includes a URI (GitHub profile link)
 - Handles connection and disconnection events
 - Automatically restarts advertising after disconnection
 - Uses Zephyr's ``k_work`` to start advertising asynchronously

Build & Run Instructions
------------------------
1. Set up your Zephyr environment and export the Zephyr base.
2. Configure your project for the esp32s3_devkitc board.
3. Build the project:

   .. code-block:: sh

      west build -b esp32s3_devkitc/esp32s3/procpu

4. Flash the firmware to the device:

   .. code-block:: sh

      west flash

5. Open a serial console at the appropriate baud rate (usually 115200) to observe logs:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200

Example Logs
------------

.. code-block:: none

Image Demonstration
-------------------
- Scan using **nRF Connect App** on your smartphone

.. image:: ./images/Connectable_adv_static_address.jpg
   :alt: Connectable advertising with static ble address
   :align: center
   :width: 600px

- You should see:
   * Device Name: ``Test Beacon`` (from ``prj.conf``)
   * ``CONNECT`` Option
   * Desired interval ``500 ms``
   * Desired or Static MAC Address ``DD:11:07:20:03:AA``
   * Manufacturer Data: Company ID ``0x02E5`` (Espressif)
   * Scan Response: URI (``https://github.com/Dishant7990``)
- Connect to the device, then disconnect â€” the device will automatically restart advertising.
