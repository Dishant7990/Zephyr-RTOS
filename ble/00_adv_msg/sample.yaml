  name: BLE Beacon Example
  description: >
    This sample demonstrates a basic Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon using the Zephyr RTOS.
    It initializes the Bluetooth subsystem and starts non-connectable advertising with both
    advertising and scan response data. The scan response includes an Eddystone-URL frame
    broadcasting a URL ("http://www.zephyrproject.org").
